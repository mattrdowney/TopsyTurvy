//tread = pushes in specific direction
//wind tunnel?
//EM fields
//Black Hole
//White Hole
//blue = bounce
//spring platforms
//black = down
//white = up
//gray = neutral
//geyser = cannon
//volcano = danger
//baloon = explosive, propels away from radius on (high velocity) contact
//certain blocks absorb velocities (light objects like baloons)
//avalanch
//mud slide
//boulders
//green = 
//red =
//yellow = canon 
//orange = electricity, move faster, jump higher
//purple = gray that can use previous velocities for loops.
//sand = dissolve/drain downward from the surface first touched;
//mud = slow player, inconvenience for time trials, can walk on all surfaces without gravity changing
//cyan = ice, 100% slip
//cloud = cannot jump, sink slowly
//water = spin enhanced, can roll on surface, gravity decreased, move speed decreased
//river current = wind tunnel + water
//

//torque spheres = green vines?
//metallic = like mud but with fast movement
